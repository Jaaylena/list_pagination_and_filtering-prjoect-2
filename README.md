# list_pagination_and_filtering-project-2

This was my second project done with very little experience or understanding of writing code. A few things that I missed and would like to correct: 
[ ] creating code that works when JS is disabled in the browser
[ ] currently have it so the text in the header changes to no students found instead we want that to appear in the body where the list was keeping the title the same. 

This app is created for a student directory 
* separating the students 10 to each page 
* making the pagination links clickable to disaply the students on each clicked number 
* created a search input for searching the students in the directory.
